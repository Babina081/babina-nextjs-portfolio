            After a few months break, I joined an IT company as a React intern,
            with the goal of becoming a frontend developer specializing in
            React.js. During this internship, I mastered Next.js and Tailwind
            CSS, translating design mockups into functional, responsive web
            applications. I also gained experience in API integration, testing,
            and Git, which enhanced my ability to deliver clean, maintainable
            code. Working alongside other developers and contributing to
            real-world projects, even though they were not deployed,
            significantly improved my problem-solving skills and expertise in
            exploring new tools and technologies. Over the course of the
            four-month internship, I learned valuable lessons from both my
            successes and mistakes. The guidance and support from my seniors and
            colleagues further fueled my passion and desire to grow as a
            developer in the days to come.
